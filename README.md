# German-Flip: Memory Card Game with German Vocabulary

German-Flip is a memory card game that aims to help players learn German vocabulary while playing. The goal is to exercise memory and concentration.

The game is intended for people of all ages, aiming to provide both educational and entertaining purposes. 

The game goal is to match pairs of cards containing German words. The challenge is remembering the positions of the cards as they are turned face down if they don’t match. 

Alongside trying to match the pairs, the players’ German vocabulary grows, and it becomes easier to recall words and their meanings.
